# Mango App API

## Idea
The idea is to create a RESTful API for preparing card queries for Kotlin application. Mango App API interacts with **Firebase Realtime Database**, gets the required data, applies some search and classification algorithms and provides an output **JSON** for the mobile app.

## Search algorithm main goals
* Provide the best match for a user according to given parameters
* A user gets content even though there is no matches
* All the given profile bunches must be tracked to avoid unwanted card repetitions
* *developing*
